# Applied Natural Langauge Processing with Python

This is my personal work reading and implementing the projects/scripts from the book "Applied Natural Langauge Processing with Python" by Taweh Beysolow II.

The scripts include the mathematical detail of each algorithm/concept, a detailed commentation on what the algorithms are doing (sometimes including printouts), and a few applications or alterations for exploration.
