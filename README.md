# Applied Natural Langauge Processing with Python

This is my personal work reading and implementing the projects/scripts from the book *Applied Natural Langauge Processing with Python* by Taweh Beysolow II.

The scripts include the mathematical detail of each algorithm/concept, a detailed commentation on what the algorithms are doing (sometimes including printouts), and a few applications or alterations for exploration.

Please note that the GloVe dataset used in *Chapter 4 Word Embeddings* is too big for GitHub and the Question and Answer dataset used in *Chapter 5 Sequence to Sequence Generation* could not be found, though the script is still commented and should be useful.
